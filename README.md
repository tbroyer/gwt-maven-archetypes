====================

This project contains Maven archetypes for modular GWT projects.

How to use
----------

In order to generate a modular GWT project from the available archetypes, first
you need to clone and install this project locally:

    git clone https://github.com/tbroyer/gwt-maven-archetypes.git
    cd gwt-maven-archetypes && mvn clean install

### Generate a project

    mvn archetype:generate \
       -DarchetypeGroupId=net.ltgt.gwt.archetypes \
       -DarchetypeArtifactId=<artifactId> \
       -DarchetypeVersion=1.0-SNAPSHOT

where the available `<artifactIds>` are:

* `modular-webapp`
* `modular-requestfactory`
* `guice-rf-activities`

### Start the development mode

Change directory to your generated project and issue the following commands:

1. `mvn clean install -Dgwt.compiler.skip`
2. In one terminal window: `cd *-server && mvn jetty:start -Ddev`
3. In another terminal window: `cd *-client && mvn gwt:run -Ddev`

### Profiles

There are two profiles defined in the POM file of client module:

* `dev` is to speed-up development with `gwt:run` and `jetty:start` by not
  requiring a restart when a change to the `${rootArtifactId}-shared` is made
* `draft` is to speed-up GWT compilation, and will only compile (by default)
  for WebKit-based browsers (Safari, Chrome)

To activate `dev` or `draft` you can provide the `-Ddev` or `-Ddraft` system
properties respectively, or use `-Pdev` or `-Pdraft`.

Note that the DevMode (`gwt:run`) won't work after a compilation made with the
`draft` profile. You'll have to `mvn clean` the project first and start over.

### Productivity tips

When working on the server-side code exclusively, you don't need GWT's DevMode.
You can then compile the GWT app using `mvn package` or `mvn package -Ddraft`
and then `cd *-server && mvn jetty:start -Ddev`. The webapp will be redeployed
automatically when you change a class (either compiled by your IDE, or by `mvn
compile`) in either the `${rootArtifactId}-server` or
`${rootArtifactId}-shared` module (be careful though when changing classes in
`shared` that you do not break the GWT client code, particularly when using
GWT-RPC).

When working on the client-side code exclusively, to quickly test it in a
browser in production mode, use `mvn package -Ddraft`. You can use `mvn package
-Ddraft -pl :${rootArtifactId}-client -am` while the Jetty server is running
(launched by `cd *-server && mvn jetty:start -Ddev`), and then simply hit `F5`
in your browser. Make sure you use a browser compatible with the one declared
in the `${rootArtifactId}-client/src/main/java/${package}/${module}_dev.gwt.xml`
file (by default, Safari or Chrome).

Compatibility
-------------

To use variable interpolation in parameters during `mvn archetype:generate`,
you need at least version 2.2 of the maven-archetype-plugin. Archetypes use
`${module.toLowerCase()}` as the default value for the `module-short-name`
parameter, so if you don't use version 2.2 or above of the
maven-archetype-plugin, make sure you provide a value and do not use the
default one for that parameter. You can also make sure you use version 2.2 of
the plugin by using `mvn
org.apache.maven.plugins:maven-archetype-plugin:2.2:generate` instead of `mvn
archetype:generate`.
